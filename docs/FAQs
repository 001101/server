1. I am not able to upload large files. Is that not supported by ownCloud?
		Ofcourse it is supported. The problem lies with the PHP configuration. If you have access to php.ini file (which resides in /etc/php5/apache2 folder) then you can fix this issue by changing the following lines :
							; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
							upload_max_filesize = 2M
	In place of 2M write the maximum size you want to be allowed.

2. I tried to install the ownCloud in some XYZ directory but its not working.
	Unfortunately ownCloud can be installed into your default Apache directory only which is /var/www/ for most of the distributions.
