1. I am not able to upload large files. Is that not supported by ownCloud?
		Ofcourse it is supported. The problem lies with the PHP configuration. If you have access to php.ini file (which resides in /etc/php5/apache2 folder) then you can fix this issue by changing the following lines :
							; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
							upload_max_filesize = 2M
							
		Also look for the following line:
							post_max_size= 2M
	In place of 2M write the maximum size you want to be allowed.
