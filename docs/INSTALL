== PREREQUISITS ==
php5
sqlite

== SETUP ==
Place owncloud in a subdirectory of your web server. Go to that directory with
a web browser and the first run wizard should take it from there.
Set up your paths in:
config/config.php
Check out config/config.sample.php for details if you want to set config.php manually.

Your data will be in:
$CONFIG_DATADIRECTORY = '/www/testy';
Apache needs to have write permissions to this directory.

And the ownCloud path is:
$CONFIG_DOCUMENTROOT = '/www/owncloud/htdocs';
The ownCloud checkout should be in the root of "htdocs".

Both are absolute paths, so if your server is in /var/www, you need to add the /var

== Database ==
The database is sqlite. If you are having trouble make sure that the line

extension=sqlite.so

appears in your php.ini
