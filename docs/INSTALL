== PREREQUISITS ==
php5
currently mysql, should optionally be sqlite

== SETUP ==
Set up your paths in:
config/config.php

Your data will be in:
$CONFIG_DATADIRECTORY = '/www/testy';
Apache needs to have write permissions to this directory.

And the ownCloud path is:
$CONFIG_DOCUMENTROOT = '/www/owncloud/htdocs';
The ownCloud checkout should be in the root of "htdocs".

Both are absolute paths, so if your server is in /var/www, you need to add the /var


== Database ==
The database should by default be sqlite. No configuration there.

But until then you need some setup with mysql:

Create a table "owncloud":
mysqladmin create owncloud -u root -p

Dump the default database schema:
mysql owncloud -u root -p < owncloud.sql

TODO: you also need to create a mysql user that is configured in config/config.php
