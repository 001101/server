/**
 * Behat context to run each scenario against a clean Nextcloud server.
 *
 * Before each scenario is run, this context sets up a fresh Nextcloud server
 * with predefined data and configuration. Thanks to this every scenario is
 * independent from the others and they all know the initial state of the
 * server.
 *
 * This context is expected to be used along with RawMinkContext contexts (or
 * subclasses). As the server address can be different for each scenario, this
 * context automatically sets the "base_url" parameter of all its sibling
 * RawMinkContexts; just add NextcloudTestServerContext to the context list of a
 * suite in "behat.yml".
 *
 * The Nextcloud server is set up by running a new Docker container; the Docker
 * image used by the container must provide a Nextcloud server ready to be used
 * by the tests. By default, the image "nextcloud-local-test-acceptance" is
 * used, although that can be customized using the "dockerImageName" parameter
 * in "behat.yml". In the same way, the range of ports in which the Nextcloud
 * server will be published in the local host (by default, "15000-16000") can be
 * customized using the "hostPortRangeForContainer" parameter.
 *
 * Note that using Docker containers as a regular user requires giving access to
 * the Docker daemon to that user. Unfortunately, that makes possible for that
 * user to get root privileges for the system. Please see the
 * NextcloudTestServerDockerHelper documentation for further information on this
 * issue.
