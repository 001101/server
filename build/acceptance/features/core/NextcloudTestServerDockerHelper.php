/**
 * Helper to manage the Docker container for the Nextcloud test server.
 *
 * The NextcloudTestServerDockerHelper abstracts the calls to the Docker Command
 * Line Interface (the "docker" command) to run, get information from, and
 * destroy containers. It is not a generic abstraction, but one tailored
 * specifically to the Nextcloud test server; a Docker image that provides an
 * installed and ready to run Nextcloud server with the configuration and data
 * expected by the acceptance tests must be available in the system. The
 * Nextcloud server must use a local storage so all the changes it makes are
 * confined to its running container.
 *
 * Also, the Nextcloud server installed in the Docker image is expected to see
 * "127.0.0.1" as a trusted domain (which would be the case if it was installed
 * by running "occ maintenance:install"). Therefore, the Nextcloud server is
 * accessed through a local port in the host system mapped to the port 80 of the
 * Docker container; if the Nextcloud server was instead accessed directly
 * through its IP address it would complain that it was being accessed from an
 * untrusted domain and refuse to work until the admin whitelisted it. The base
 * URL to access the Nextcloud server can be got from "getBaseUrl".
 *
 * For better compatibility, Docker CLI commands used internally follow the
 * pre-1.13 syntax (also available in 1.13 and newer). For example,
 * "docker start" instead of "docker container start".
 *
 * In any case, the "docker" command requires special permissions to talk to the
 * Docker daemon, and those permissions are typically available only to the root
 * user. However, you should NOT run the acceptance tests as root, but as a
 * regular user instead. Please see the Docker documentation to find out how to
 * give access to a regular user to the Docker daemon:
 * https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/
 *
 * Note, however, that being able to communicate with the Docker daemon is the
 * same as being able to get root privileges for the system. Therefore, you must
 * give access to the Docker daemon (and thus run the acceptance tests as) ONLY
 * to trusted and secure users:
 * https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
 *
 * All the public methods that use the 'docker' command throw an exception if
 * the command can not be executed or if it does not have enough permissions to
 * connect to the Docker daemon; as, due to the current use of this class, it is
 * just a warning for the test runner and nothing to be explicitly catched a
 * plain base Exception is used.
