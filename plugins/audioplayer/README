This plugin implements a very basic HTML5 audio preview for ownCloud.

Only formats supported by the browser can be played.
Sadly, those are very limited and not coherent among browsers, see http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/ for more info.

Ideas to change that (TODO):
- Flashplayer fallback
and/or
- on-the-fly transcoding
